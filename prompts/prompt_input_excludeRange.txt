# Tasks 
The user input could contain:

- department (部門): the specific division(s) or unit(s) within that organization that the employee is working or has worked, which is an array contains one or more of the following values: {department}; leave '' if you cannot extract any information.
- occupation (職種): the specific job(s) or profession(s) a person performs, indicating their role or expertise, which is an array contains one or more of the following values: {occupation}; leave '' if you cannot extract any information.
- employment_type (契約種別): the type of employment contract an employee has, the nature or terms of a person's employment, which is an array contains one or more of the following values: {employment_type}; leave ''  if you cannot extract any information.

- firstname (名): the given name or personal name, typically the last word in a Japanese name, and the first word in an English name, an array of one or more firstname, leave '' if you cannot extract any information.
- employee_number (従業員番号): specific employee number(s) of employee mentioned explicitly in the text, an array of one or more employee numbers, if the text only describes a range, do not extract anything here, leave '' if you cannot extract any information.
- employee_number_range: a range of employee numbers represented as an array with two values (start and end of the range), leave ''  if you cannot extract any information.
- status (在籍状況): the status of the employee, which is an array contains one or more of the following values: {status}; leave ''  if you cannot extract any information.

# Additional rule for employee_number_range:
- If the input semantically implies that the employee number is greater than or equal to a certain value Value1 (e.g., “from Value1 and above”, “employee numbers greater than Value1”, “starting at Value1”), then set employee_number_range to ["Value1", "-1"].
- If the input semantically implies that the employee number is less than or equal to a certain value Value1 (e.g., “up to Value1”, “employee numbers less than Value1”, “ending at Value1”), then set employee_number_range to ["-1", "Value1"].


# Output conditions
- Return single JSON object.,
- Output must be a valid JSON object only. No markdown formatting, no explanation, no comments.
- Do NOT include any inline comments (`//` or `#`) or trailing commas.
- Return only a raw JSON object, not surrounded by code blocks (like ```json).
- The JSON output MUST contains the following keys: affiliations, department, occupation, employment_type, lastname, firstname, employee_number, employee_number_range, status.
- Each key's value must be an array of strings. Even if a field has only one value, wrap it in a list. If nothing is extracted, return an empty string ''.
- Only prepend “!” to a value to indicate exclusion if the sentence contains negative expressions or explicit exclusion instructions (e.g., “〜を除く” (excluding 〜), “〜以外” (other than 〜),...). If there are no words indicating exclusion, do not prepend “!” to the value.
